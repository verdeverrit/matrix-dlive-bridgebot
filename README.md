This app is a simple python bridgebot based chat bridge to allow for interaction between a matrix server room and a dlive channel. 
It requires a dedicated bot account on each end with access to the respective APIs.
The code is free to use, but the authentication server is not open.
Authentication information will NOT be provided unless you organise it.

Usage:
the bot is nowhere near to completion, instructions to come
